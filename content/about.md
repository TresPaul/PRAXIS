“Praxis” is to analyse ideas, identify problems, find answers, and engage in the process of enacting change – the dialectic synthesis of *theory* and *practice*.

PRAXIS is a new podcast project that will analyse concepts relevant to students as citizens of a university, a country, and the world. The medium itself is important: PRAXIS seeks to fill a certain (currently unoccupied) niche in the campus media landscape, but also to experiment with and challenge the auditory medium, technically and narratively.

Using the podcast medium will allow people to tell their own stories, without being filtered by a journalist’s interpretation. The tone will be conversational but educational, and as serious as necessary. The goal is to make large concepts available to the regular but interested student, therefore we will not hesitate to engage with relevant academic concepts.

PRAXIS will strive to be a progressive voice on campus, holding the wellbeing of all humans in the highest regard. This mission will however not preclude from engaging with alternative ideological, political, social, and philosophical perspectives. Indeed, in order to achieve "truth", such alternative perspectives must be given an accurate representation, in order to understand why they exist and what to do with them.

PRAXIS is a part of [iLizwi.co.za](http://ilizwi.co.za).
